# Twitter-Sentiment-analysis
twitter sentiment analysis using tweepy, textblob and backpropagation neural network.

Sentiment analysis is the automated process of identifying and classifying subjective information in text data. This might be an opinion, a judgment, or a feeling about a particular topic or product feature. The most common type of sentiment analysis is called ‘polarity detection’ and involves classifying a statement as ‘positive’, ‘negative’ or ‘neutral’.  
Twitter sentiment analysis is essential for monitoring sudden shifts in customer moods, detecting if complaints are on the rise, and for taking action before problems escalate. With sentiment analysis, you can monitor brand mentions on Twitter in real-time and gain actionable insights. 
In Twitter Sentiment Analysis, we analysis the tweets in three different categories like Positive tweets, Negative tweets, and Neutral tweets. For this I used different module of python and Soft Computing Techniques.    
eg: “Ram is very bad in sports.” --- Negative Polarity 
      “Mohan is very good in study.” ---Positive Polarit
      
      
 for run this module you have to run only main file from the repositry.
